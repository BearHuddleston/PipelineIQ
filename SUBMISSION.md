# PipelineIQ Submission

## Project Overview

PipelineIQ is a full-stack application built with Go and TypeScript that demonstrates a complete data pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Concurrently fetches data from multiple external APIs
2. **Data Processing**: Combines and transforms raw data into meaningful insights
3. **LLM Analysis**: Uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate human-readable analysis
4. **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays the processed data and insights in a React frontend

## Features

- **Concurrent API Data Fetching**: Utilizes Go's goroutines for parallel data retrieval
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Transforms and combines data from multiple sources
- **LLM-Powered Insights**: Generates natural language analysis of processed data
- **Responsive React Frontend**: User-friendly dashboard to view results and trigger the pipeline
- **Containerized Deployment**: Complete Docker setup for easy deployment
- **Database Persistence**: Stores all data stages in PostgreSQL with GORM

## Technical Highlights

- **Backend**: Go with Gin framework and GORM ORM
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **Testing**: Unit tests for critical components

## Getting Started

1. Configure environment variables in `.env` file
2. Run with Docker Compose: `docker-compose up --build`
3. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost`

## Notes on Development Process

The project was developed in distinct phases:

1. **Project Setup & Backend Foundation**: Basic Go project structure with Gin and GORM
2. **Backend Core Logic**: Implementation of service layer and API endpoints
3. **Frontend Development**: React dashboard with TypeScript and API integration
4. **Dockerization & Documentation**: Container setup and comprehensive documentation

Each phase was committed separately to show progression of development.

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication and user management
- Implement WebSockets for real-time updates
- Add more detailed visualizations for data analysis
- Expand test coverage with integration tests
